 * Description: This program creates a utility called "countnames" that reads
 * names from a file or from standard input, one name per line. It counts how
 * many times each name appears (up to 100 distinct names) and prints the
 * results as "name: count". Empty lines are skipped and generate a warning
 * message to stderr.

## Lessons Learned

Jada Lien Nguyen-
This assignment helped me get more comfortable working in C and understanding how programs are structured from start to finish. I practiced handling file input, working with strings in C (which is very different from higher-level languages), and managing memory carefully. It also reinforced how important it is to check for errors, especially when opening files. Overall, it helped me better understand how UNIX-style utilities are built and how small design decisions affect program behavior.
